The idea behind shuffler is simple: input items and create a list that can be shuffled.

It originally started out as an idea to shuffle book titles but I soon realized that it can be applied to anything, this is why the project folder is called book_shuffler.

These are the following requirements:
Django (1.11.2)
pip (9.0.1)
pytz (2017.2)
setuptools (36.0.1)
wheel (0.29.0)

Feel free to use it, it doesn't protect handle XSS because it is just a simple tool that I created for a simple purpose.
I did borrow 4 lines of code that are based on Fisher-Yates shuffle provided Alexey Lebedev on Stack Overflow.
